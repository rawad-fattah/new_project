# React + Vite
in this project i used react to build the frontend with vite <br />
to run the code locally:<br />
1-clone this repository on your device => git clone (url) my_app<br />
2-make change directory path to my_app folder => cd my_app<br />
3-run npm install command <br />
4-run npm run dev commad <br />
then this will show a url, use it in the browser then the ui will be shown clearly<br />
